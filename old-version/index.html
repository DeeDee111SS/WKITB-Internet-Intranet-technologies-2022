                    <p><b>Brendan Eich</b> (<i>born July 4, 1961</i>) is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He
                        created the
                        JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla
                        Corporation.
                        He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer before he was appointed chief executive officer, but
                        resigned shortly after his appointment due to controversy over his opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently
                        became the CEO of Brave Software.</p>
